# RationalCyber

A repository containing schematics for an automated cyber security detection &amp; response eco-system with open extendable syntax for practical sharing of use-cases, automation scripts and rules definitions

# The expected values of the project:
+ Standardize the definition of cyber security assessment and handling use-cases
+ Define a credible workflow format with the appropriate functions to support the cyber-security kill chain from start to end and enable automation of processes
+ Define a suggested topology and a technological framework for the enablement of the project
